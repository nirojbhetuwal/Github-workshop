<p>
    Tigers are the most iconic of the big cats. With their gorgeous black-and-orange coats and long, white whiskers, they invoke in many a feeling of wonder and admiration.

But though they are adored, they’re also vulnerable to extinction. Around 3,890 wild tigers roam forests and savannas today. Tigers are poached for their parts and lose habitat to human activity every day.

WWF’s is committed to Tx2—the global goal of doubling the number of wild tigers by 2022. By working with tiger range countries, we are pushing forward on zero poaching across Asia even as we secure vital tiger landscapes and curb the demand for illegal tiger parts and products.
